Default Color Palette: https://lospec.com/palette-list/resurrect-32

The mouse sensitivity is changed by supplying it as the only url parameter as so: https://woxel.xyz?0.01 will set the mouse sensitivity to 0.01.

To set colors in the palette you must specify the color id (1-32) and then then HEX color as 6 characters without the #, e.g; https://woxel.xyz?1&00FFFF will set color 1 in the palette to #00FFFF (cyan).

#### Menu Palette:
* Middle Mouse clicking the color palette in the menu will copy the hex of the pointed color to the clipboard.
* Right Mouse clicking the color palette in the menu will randomize the color pointed to in the palette.
